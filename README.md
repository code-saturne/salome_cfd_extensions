General Information
===================

This directory contains the salome_cfd extensions for the
code_saturne (https://code-saturne.org) CFD tool,
EDF's general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software.

These extension provide better integration with the SALOME plarform
(https://www.salome-platform.org).

Presentation
============

The salome_cfd extensions provide increased integration of code_saturne
in the Salome platform, especially:

* the CFD_STUDY module for integration of the code_saturne GUI in the SALOME
  workbench; this also allows visualization of probe positions and boundary
  groups relative to the mesh;

* integration with OpenTURNS and the PERSALYS graphical interface for
  sensitivity studies.
